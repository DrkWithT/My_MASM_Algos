# Euclid Algorithm MASM
## By: Derek Tan

### Summary:
This is an assembly practice project containing my practice code in 2 files. The file `Test.asm` contains a hex digit printing procedure for WORD types. Maybe I should have used `WriteHex`! The file `Test2.asm` contains a simple implementation of the Euclidean Algorithm. This algorithm is often used to find the GCD of two integers.

### Dependencies & Needed Programs: üë®‚Äçüíª
 - The preferred IDE is Visual Studio 2022. Install this first!
 - The VCS is Git for Windows. Install this with VS 2022.
 - The code requires the `Irvine32` MASM library. The reference to install it is below.
